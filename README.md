# Live coding repository

This is a jumble of a repo with my live coding... stuff. It's almost entirely
programmatic music for Sonic Pi though I might experiment with other
environments and tools.

Layout:

  * `sessions/` - results of noodling around
  * `practice/` - small snippets for exercise and/or warm-up
  * `lib/` - utility/helper code
